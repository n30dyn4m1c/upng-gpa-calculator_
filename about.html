      <h1>About This Calculator</h1>
      <p>A tool to help students of the University of Papua New Guinea calculate their GPA and CGPA with accuracy and ease.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Features</h4>
    <p>
      The UPNG GPA Calculator is designed to offer a user-friendly and efficient solution for calculating both semester-based GPA and cumulative CGPA. It is built specifically for students at the University of Papua New Guinea, the calculator simplifies what is traditionally a tedious and error-prone task.
    </p>
    <p>
      For GPA calculations, users can input or search and select course codes or course names. Course credit values are automatically added for courses selected. Users then select grades received for a specific semester. Correct grade points will be automatically calculated. The calculator then computes the Grade Point Average using UPNG’s official grading formula. The GPA is computed using a weighted average based on the credit values assigned to each course.
    </p>
    <p>
      For CGPA, the tool supports cumulative calculations across multiple semesters or academic years. It correctly handles repeat courses by selecting the highest grade achieved for any repeated course and excluding lower attempts from the computation. This ensures alignment with university policy and gives students an accurate reflection of their standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The application is mobile-responsive, ensuring accessibility across devices. It features an autocomplete course list drawn from official UPNG course data to speed up data entry and reduce errors. Designed to be lightweight and fast, it works seamlessly even in low-connectivity environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The method for GPA/CGPA calculation here are the same as those used in the official UPNG student systems. 
    </p>
